Most local restaurants, massage shops, markets and small businesses only accept cash. Bigger restaurants, hotels and convenience stores like 7-Eleven take Visa and Mastercard, but don&rsquo;t count on it everywhere. Always have cash on hand.</p><p><img src=/images/thai-baht-bills.jpg alt="Thai Baht banknotes"></p><p><em>Photo by Q L on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-of-thai-currency-featuring-20-baht-note-29917029/>Pexels</a> (free to use)</em></p><h2 id=atms>ATMs</h2><p>ATMs are scattered across the island, mostly at 7-Elevens and bank branches. You&rsquo;ll find them in Saladan, Klong Dao, Long Beach and Klong Nin. There are two banks in Saladan (SCB and TTB), and a Kasikorn ATM near Southern Lanta Resort at Klong Dao Beach.</p><p>All Thai ATMs charge a <strong>250 THB fee</strong> per withdrawal on foreign cards. This is unavoidable, so withdraw as much as you can in one go to reduce the hit.</p><h3 id=which-atm-to-use>Which ATM to use</h3><p>Not all ATMs are equal. Krungsri (yellow) ATMs let you pull 30,000 THB per transaction, while most others cap at 20,000 THB. That difference matters when you&rsquo;re paying a flat fee every time.</p><div class=table-wrap><table><thead><tr><th>Bank</th><th>ATM Color</th><th>Max per withdrawal</th><th>Fee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Krungsri</td><td>Yellow</td><td>30,000 THB</td><td>250 THB</td></tr><tr><td>Bangkok Bank</td><td>Blue</td><td>25,000 THB</td><td>250 THB</td></tr><tr><td>Kasikorn (KBank)</td><td>Green</td><td>20,000-30,000 THB</td><td>250 THB</td></tr><tr><td>SCB</td><td>Purple</td><td>20,000 THB</td><td>250 THB</td></tr><tr><td>Krungthai</td><td>Light blue</td><td>20,000 THB</td><td>250 THB</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Look for the yellow Krungsri ATMs.</strong> At 30,000 THB with a 250 THB fee, you&rsquo;re paying about 0.8%. At an SCB machine doing 20,000 THB, that same fee costs you 1.25%.</p><p>The chance of an ATM on Koh Lanta skimming your card is very, very low, but not zero. So try to use the same ATM every time you need money.</p><h3 id=decline-the-currency-conversion>Decline the currency conversion</h3><div class=tip-box><p>Important when using any ATM</p><ul><li>The ATM will ask if you want to convert to your home currency. <strong>Always say no.</strong></li><li>This is called Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) and the markup is typically 3-5% worse than your bank's own rate.</li><li>Choose "withdraw without conversion" or "charge in THB" and let your card issuer handle the conversion.</li></ul></div><h2 id=cards-for-travel>Cards for travel</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re staying for a while, a <a href=https://wise.com/invite/ath/jacobusd57>Wise card</a> is worth getting before your trip. It converts at the mid-market exchange rate with a small fee (around 0.4-0.6%) and has no foreign transaction fee on card payments. For ATM withdrawals, you get 2 free pulls per month (up to 200 EUR for EEA-issued cards, or 100 USD for US-issued cards), then a small percentage fee after that. The Thai ATM surcharge still applies on top.</p><p>Your home bank debit or credit card will also work at ATMs and larger shops, but check what foreign transaction fees they charge. Many banks add 1-3% on top of the exchange rate, which adds up over a month.</p><h2 id=mobile-payments>Mobile payments</h2><p><strong>PromptPay</strong> is Thailand&rsquo;s QR payment system. You&rsquo;ll see QR codes at many shops and restaurants, but you need a Thai bank account to use it directly.</p><p><strong>TrueMoney Wallet</strong> is more accessible for foreigners. You can sign up with your passport and a Thai SIM card, then top up at 7-Eleven (max 3,000 THB per top-up). The wallet cap is 50,000 THB. It works at shops displaying TrueMoney QR codes.</p><p>That said, most short-stay visitors just stick with cash and cards. Mobile payments are a nice bonus if you&rsquo;re here for a few months.</p><h2 id=currency-exchange>Currency exchange</h2><p>There are exchange booths around Saladan and in tourist areas along the beaches. Rates are okay but not great compared to Bangkok. SCB in Saladan has an exchange window that&rsquo;s accessible outside banking hours.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re flying through Bangkok, exchanging some cash at a SuperRich counter at Suvarnabhumi Airport will get you a better rate than anything on the island. There is no SuperRich in Krabi or on Koh Lanta.</p><p>For the best overall rate, use a <a href=https://wise.com/invite/ath/jacobusd57>Wise card</a> for purchases and withdraw cash from Krungsri ATMs when you need it.</p><h2 id=tipping>Tipping</h2><p>Tipping is not required in Thailand, but it&rsquo;s appreciated in tourist areas. Some rough guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> Check if a 10% service charge is on the bill. If not, leaving 5-10% for good service is a nice gesture. At local Thai restaurants and street food stalls, tipping is uncommon. Rounding up or leaving the coins is fine.</li><li><strong>Massage:</strong> 50-100 THB for a standard Thai massage. 100-200 THB for longer spa treatments. Hand it directly to the therapist.</li><li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Not expected. Rounding up the fare by 10-20 THB is enough.</li><li><strong>Hotel staff:</strong> 20-50 THB for porters or housekeeping if you feel like it.</li></ul></div><nav style="margin-top:3rem;padding-top:2rem;border-top:2px solid #e2e8f0;text-align:center"><a class=back-link href=/ style="display:inline-block;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#0891b2 0%,#06b6d4 100%);color:#fff;padding:.75rem 2rem;border-radius:8px;font-weight:500;transition:transform .2s">← Back to All Topics</a></nav></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=wrap><p style=margin:0>🏝️ Lanta Nomads - Your guide to remote work paradise</p><p style="margin:.5rem 0 0;opacity:.9;font-size:.9rem">© 2026 All rights reserved</p></div></footer><script async src=https://betterlytics.io/analytics.js data-site-id=lantanomads-mlq9v4m7></script></body></html>
