# Activities

## Cooking Classes

### [Time for Lime](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Time+For+Lime+Koh+Lanta)

The original Thai cooking school on Koh Lanta, open since 2002. Located on Klong Dao Beach in an open-air beachfront setting with a pool. Classes run ~5.5 hours — you make curry paste, 2 starters, and 2 main courses, then eat what you cooked. A cocktail class is included in some packages. Recipes are sent home with you.

A portion of all profits goes to [Lanta Animal Welfare](https://www.lantaanimalwelfare.com/), which rescues and treats stray animals on the island.

**Prices:**

- Single experience: 2,000 THB/person
- Cooking & Cocktail experience (pair): 4,000 THB for two
- Partner package (pair): 3,400 THB for two
- Children: 990 THB

**Schedule:** Monday–Saturday (closed Sunday)

**Book directly at [timeforlime.net](https://timeforlime.net)** — they prefer direct bookings so more goes to the animals.
