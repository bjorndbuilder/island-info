## Paying

Paying with cash is the norm on the island. You can pay with credit/debit card in the bigger restaurants and shops but usually there is a fee and a minimum amount. Mobile payment apps with QR-codes like PromptPay and Moreta are becoming more popular but are still not widely accepted. And some can only be used by locals.

## ATMs

The Yellow ATMs will give you 30.000 THB, the others are limited to 20.000 THB. Try to take out as much as possible at once to avoid multiple fees. Most ATMs charge a fee of around 250 THB per transaction for foreign cards. Check with your bank before you travel for any additional fees they may charge. When a ATM offers conversion to your home currency, it is usually better to decline and let your bank do the conversion.

## Currency Exchange

There are a few exchange booths are available on the island. The rates can vary and it is recommended to get money from an ATM for the best rates.

## Tipping

Tipping is optional in Thailand, but it is appreciated. For taxi drivers, rounding up the fare or leaving a small tip is customary.
