# Transportation

## Scooter rental

You can rent scooters almost everywhere on the island. The price is around 250-300 THB per day, depending on the season and the condition of the scooter. If you rent longer than a week you'll get a better price. For example 5000 THB per month.

[Nare Scooter Rental Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HbMNqjybkxesGZ9t6) has nicer, newer and better scooters than most.

If you don't have a driver's license or you don't feel comfortable driving a scooter, you can rent an e-bike from [Koh Lanta Bike Rentals](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uipWxpP8qxHMzeKG8) instead.
