[93 countries](https://www.tourismthailand.org/Articles/visa-free-entry-to-thailand-en) get **60 days visa-free**. That's enough for most visitors. You can extend by 30 days at immigration if you want to stay longer, or apply for a tourist visa (60 days) before your trip.

Before you fly, fill out the [Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)](https://tdac.immigration.go.th). It's required within 72 hours of arrival.

If you're planning to stay and work remotely, look into the **Destination Thailand Visa (DTV)**. It's a 5-year multiple-entry visa with 180-day stays that can be extended by another 180 days. Costs 10.000 THB to apply and you need 500.000 THB in the bank.

## Extending your stay

A 30-day extension costs 1,900 THB. You'll need your passport, a passport photo, copies of your passport pages, and the address of where you're staying.

The nearest immigration office is in [Krabi Town](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Krabi+Immigration+Office), but it's easier to use a visa agent on the island. They handle the paperwork and the trip for you.

## Visa agents on Koh Lanta

They can handle extensions, 90-day reports, and re-entry permits. You give them your passport and they bring it back done.

## 90-day reporting

Staying longer than 90 days? You need to report your address to immigration every 90 days. You can do this online through the [TM47 system](https://tm47.immigration.go.th) or through a visa agent.
