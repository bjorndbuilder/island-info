Most nomads stay around [Long Beach (Phra Ae)](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Long+Beach+Phra+Ae+Koh+Lanta) since it's close to [KoHub](/coworking). Prices vary a lot by season. High season (Dec-Feb) books up fast and costs roughly double what you'd pay in shoulder months (Nov, Mar-Apr). If you're coming in peak season, book ahead. Outside of that, you can often just show up and walk around.

Some places are cheaper when you message them directly on WhatsApp or Facebook. Monthly rates are almost always negotiable in person.

## KoHub Bungalows

The obvious pick if you want the full coliving/coworking setup. Private bungalows (28 sqm) right next to the KoHub coworking space, about a 5-minute walk from the beach. Each bungalow has AC, king bed, hot shower, fridge, 2 desks, office chair and 1 Gbps WiFi with its own access point.

Packages are all-inclusive (room + coworking + two meals/day):

- Low season (Nov, Apr): ~49,500 THB/month
- High season (Dec-Mar): ~59,500 THB/month
- Multi-month stays get a small discount
- Open November through April only.

The community aspect is the main draw. Weekly events, communal lunches, island trips. It's not the cheapest option, but you're paying for convenience and not having to figure everything out yourself.

The preferred way to get availability and book is by email. The address is on [KoHub.org](https://kohub.org/packages?ref=lantanomads.com).

## Lanta Buddy Resort

Literally next to Kohub. And offers a different kind of convenience with a kitchentte that has a bigger fridge, a kettle and a microwave. Garden views, terrace, quiet setting.

Book on [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/lanta-buddy-bungalow.html) or [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/66884485561?text=Hi,%20my%20name%20is%20..%20and%20I%20found%20you%20on%20LantaNomads.com.%20Do%20you%20have%20availability%20between%20..%20and%20..?)

## Baan Long Haad

Tiny place with just four bungalows, one minute from Long Beach. Rated 9.2 on Booking.com. AC, TV, small terrace overlooking greenery. The owner is really welcoming. Very quiet since there are so few rooms. A few guests have noted the WiFi can be unreliable, so if you need rock-solid internet for calls, check with them first or plan to work from KoHub.

## Cheeky Monkey / Anna House

Nice bungalows with kitchen. Across the road from Kohub.

Not much of an online presence, so you won't find many reviews. Ask in the nomad community for recent experiences.

## Other places

These are on the list from locals but don't have much of an online footprint. Worth checking out if you're walking around Long Beach and looking at places in person:

- **Forest House** - ask around near Long Beach
- **The Travellers Friend Bungalows** - small local guesthouse

## Tips for booking

- **High season (Dec-Feb):** Book at least a few weeks ahead for the popular spots. Prices are at their highest.
- **Shoulder season (Nov, Mar-Apr):** Good availability, reasonable prices. You can book a few days before or just show up.
- **Low season (May-Oct):** Many places close entirely. Those that stay open offer big discounts (50%+), but the island is very quiet and some restaurants shut down too.
- **Monthly rates:** Most places will negotiate a monthly rate if you ask, especially for stays of 4+ weeks. This usually only works in person or via WhatsApp, not through booking platforms.
- **Agoda vs Booking.com:** Compare both. Agoda tends to have better prices for Thai hotels. Some smaller places are only on one platform.
- **Walk-in rates:** In shoulder and low season, walking in and asking can get you a better deal than online. In high season, this is risky since good places fill up.
